Assumptions
The user credentials are stored locally for demo purposes (default credentials: username admin, password password).
No back-end database is connected in the local setup, so data is not persistent between sessions.
A login page serves as the home page for this project.

Task Dashboard: A centralized dashboard allows users to create, manage, and track tasks.
Responsive Design: The project is mobile-responsive, with a desktop-first layout and mobile adjustments.
Chart Integration: Task trends are visualized with react-chartjs-2 (requires compatibility with React version 18 or lower).
Custom Fonts: Custom fonts are loaded for enhanced aesthetics.
